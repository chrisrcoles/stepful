# Problem Statement

## Take-home prompt: a Coaching Conundrum

Stepful is getting too busy! We have hundreds of 1-on-1 coaching calls between our students and coaches, and we need you to build a website to manage their scheduling.

Your website should satisfy the following user stories:

**Requirements**
- [X] Coaches can add slots of availability to their calendars. These slots are always 2 hours long and each slot can be booked by exactly 1 student.
- [X] Coaches can view their own upcoming slots.
- [X] Students can book upcoming, available slots for any coach.
- [X] When a slot is booked, both the student and coach can view each other’s phone-number.
- [X] After they complete a call with a student, coaches will record the student’s satisfaction (an integer 1-5) and write some free-form notes.
- [X] Coaches should be able to review their past scores and notes for all of their calls.

For the sake of testing, we should be able to easily switch between being a coach vs. a student.

To save time, you don’t need to worry about a user-creation flow nor authentication, just make sure to create some users in your database for testing!
